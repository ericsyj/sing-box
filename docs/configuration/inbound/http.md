### Listen Fields

See [Listen Fields](/configuration/shared/listen/) for details.

### Fields

#### version

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.15.0"

List of HTTP versions to serve.

Available values: `1`, `2`, `3`.

`1` and `2` are used by default.

TLS is required for `3`.

#### tls

TLS configuration, see [TLS](/configuration/shared/tls/#inbound).

#### users

HTTP users.

No authentication required if empty.

#### set_system_proxy

!!! quote ""

    Only supported on Linux, Android, Windows, and macOS.

!!! warning ""

    To work on Android and Apple platforms without privileges, use tun.platform.http_proxy instead.

    On Windows, `set_system_proxy` applies to the logged-on user even when
    sing-box runs as LocalSystem, including Microsoft accounts. If the
    interactive session is not available yet, the inbound still starts and
    the proxy is applied when a user logs on. Shutdown clears the user
    proxy even if the service does not start again after reboot.

Automatically set system proxy configuration when start and clean up when stop.

### HTTP2 Fields

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.15.0"

When `version` contains `2`.

See [HTTP2 Fields](/configuration/shared/http2/) for details.

### QUIC Fields

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.15.0"

When `version` contains `3`, [HTTP2 Fields](#http2-fields) are replaced by QUIC Fields.

See [QUIC Fields](/configuration/shared/quic/) for details.
